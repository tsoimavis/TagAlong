A vast majority of people tend to forget to carry their belonging from time to time. There is a demanding need for a Bluetooth tracking device that notifies the user when they don't have the item with them. However, the current market price for a tracking device range from $20-$30 each, which is not cost-efficient. To deal with this issue, we developed an iOS application reminder system, Tag Along, using NFC tag technology that tracks and notifies the user when they forget their belongings.
