 ### Motivation
  A vast majority of people tend to forget to carry their belonging from time to time. There is a demanding need for a Bluetooth tracking device that notifies the user when they don't have the item with them. However, the current market price for a tracking device range from $20-$30 each, which is not cost-efficient. To deal with this issue, we developed an iOS application reminder system, Tag Along, using NFC tag technology that tracks and notifies the user when they forget their belongings. 
  By using NFC tags, with a price range of $0.5-$2 per tag, users can have a similar experience as using the other products in the market. Additionally, the tags come in small sticker sizes that can easily be attached to any item without any hindrance. By using our mobile application with a simple design interface, users can effortlessly navigate through their lives and focus on other task while leaving the burden to remembering items to the application.
